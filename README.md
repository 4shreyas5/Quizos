Quizos is an online platform that addresses the challenge of skill demonstration by offering interactive quizzes tailored to various domains. It provides individuals with an engaging and dynamic way to showcase their knowledge and expertise, allowing them to prove their skills to potential employers, clients, or collaborators in a fun and effective manner.
Quizos leverages the power of the Tezos blockchain to ensure secure and transparent storage of quiz results. By utilizing the unique features of Tezos, Quizos transforms quiz performance into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs can be easily shared, showcased, and validated.


## Problem Statement

- Difficulty in Demonstrating Skills in the Online World.
- Online platforms struggle to establish trust and provide reliable verification mechanisms for individuals' claimed skills, leading to skepticism and uncertainty among potential employers or collaborators.
